# retail-performance
This project involved architecting a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) system for a retail chain, enabling the analysis and optimization of store performance. 
Key components, including a data warehouse on Snowflake, an ELT program for transactional datasets, and dimensional data model schemas (STAR & SNOWFLAKE), were designed and implemented. 
The integration of an OLAP reporting system and a data visualization layer facilitated meaningful insights. 
By answering critical questions, such as assessing sales performance, recommending bonus amounts, and analyzing sales trends, the project empowered the retail chain to make informed decisions, maximize profits, and strategize for continued success.
